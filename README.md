# Image Filter 2

image filter 2 is extended version of image filter I made before:)

You can choose image from gallery or taking photo.

At this moment, you cannot save the image, but it will come soon.

# Set up

You need expo-cli newer than 2.6.13 (because my environment uses 2.6.13, so newer version should be fine but older version cannot be sure)

Clone this repo, and run

```
npm -i
```

once it finishes, run

```
expo start
```

You also need install Expo app on your mobile device.

With your device, you can scan QR code appears on the terminal to use my app!

Enjoy :)
